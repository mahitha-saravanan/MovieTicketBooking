This is a repository of my movie ticket booking project . I did this using Core java on eclipse as a java project . Initially the user is requested to enter their number and it is validated for 10 digits . If true a random 4 digit number will be generated as otp (else the project will be terminated they have to retry) and they are asked to re enter the otp . If the otp is correct they are shown a matrix of seats arrangement and asked to choose number of seats required , the given value will be validated with the minimum and maximum booking capacity . Later the user is shown with the available seats in that matrix and they should enter the seat number and where it will be reserved for them .
